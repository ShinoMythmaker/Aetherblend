TIPS: dict[str, str] = {
    "Tip 1": "Press Tab to enter Edit Mode. This is where the magic happens! (Or the cursing, depending on your day.)",
    "Tip 2": "Ctrl+Z is undo. You'll use this more than you think. Like, a LOT more.",
    "Tip 3": "In Pose Mode, press Ctrl+Tab to switch between Pose and Object Mode quickly.",
    "Tip 4": "Press I to insert a keyframe. I for 'Insert', not I for 'I have no idea what I'm doing'.",
    "Tip 5": "Want smooth animations? Use the Graph Editor to adjust those F-curves. It's like sculpting, but for movement!",
    "Tip 6": "Pro tip: Save your work regularly. Blender is stable, but Murphy's Law is more stable.",
    "Tip 7": "The middle mouse button is your best friend for navigation. If you don't have one, get one. Seriously.",
    "Tip 8": "Alt+A plays your animation. Alt+A again stops it. Revolutionary, I know.",
    "Tip 9": "In Pose Mode, press R for rotate, G for grab/move, S for scale. RGS - Remember Good Stuff!",
    "Tip 10": "Auto-key is great until you accidentally keyframe something you didn't mean to. Use with caution!",
    "Tip 11": "Bones should move your mesh, not through your mesh. Check your weight painting!",
    "Tip 12": "X-ray mode (Alt+Z) lets you see and select bones through the mesh. Game changer for complex rigs!",
    "Tip 13": "The Dope Sheet is not about cool spreadsheets. It's for managing keyframes. Still pretty cool though.",
    "Tip 14": "Pressing N opens the properties panel. Pressing N again closes it. Mind = blown.",
    "Tip 15": "IK (Inverse Kinematics) makes posing limbs easier. FK (Forward Kinematics) gives you more control. Choose wisely!",
    "Tip 16": "Copy and paste poses with Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. Yes, it works in Pose Mode too!",
    "Tip 17": "NLA Editor is for non-linear animation. Linear animations are so last century anyway.",
    "Tip 18": "If your rig is inside-out, you probably have negative scale somewhere. Check your armature!",
    "Tip 19": "Bones are invisible in renders by default. This is a feature, not a bug. You're welcome.",
    "Tip 20": "Press A to select all. Press Alt+A to deselect all. Press Alt+A during animation playback to stop. Confusing? Yes.",
    "Tip 21": "The Timeline is at the bottom of your screen. If you can't see it, you probably closed it. Right-click to get it back!",
    "Tip 22": "Constraints are powerful! But they can also create circular dependencies. Choose your constraint targets wisely.",
    "Tip 23": "Euler rotations can gimbal lock. Quaternions won't. But Euler is easier to read. Life is full of compromises.",
    "Tip 24": "Want to clear a rotation? Alt+R. Clear location? Alt+G. Clear scale? Alt+S. Clear your mind? Alt+F4 (just kidding!).",
    "Tip 25": "The pose library is great for saving common poses. Future you will thank present you!",
    "Tip 26": "Shift+D duplicates. But in Pose Mode, it duplicates the pose. In Object Mode, the object. Context matters!",
    "Tip 27": "If everything is going wrong, try turning it off and on again. File > Revert works wonders.",
    "Tip 28": "Pressing 1-9 on the numpad changes your view angle. No numpad? Sorry, that's rough buddy.",
    "Tip 29": "Bone names ending in .L or .R enable X-axis mirror. Blender is smarter than it looks!",
    "Tip 30": "The default cube is not part of your character rig. You can delete it. It's okay, we all started there.",
    "Tip 31": "Interpolation modes: Constant (robotic), Linear (smooth-ish), Bezier (smooth). Pick your flavor!",
    "Tip 32": "Pressing Z opens the shading menu. It's not undo! That's Ctrl+Z. Don't mix them up at 3am.",
    "Tip 33": "Parent your mesh to your armature with Ctrl+P > Automatic Weights. It's like magic, but 60% of the time it works every time.",
    "Tip 34": "Bone constraints can target other bones, objects, or even nothing. The nothing targets are usually accidents.",
    "Tip 35": "If your character's arm bends the wrong way, check your bone roll. It's probably having an identity crisis.",
    "Tip 36": "Coffee is not a Blender feature, but it should be. Take breaks, your eyes will thank you!",
    "Tip 37": "The 3D cursor is that weird circle thing. It's actually useful for setting pivot points and origins!",
    "Tip 38": "Proportional editing (O key) is great for posing! It moves nearby bones too. Like a gravity well, but for bones.",
    "Tip 39": "Timeline markers (M key) help you organize your animation. Name them! 'Marker.001' tells you nothing.",
    "Tip 40": "If a bone won't move, it's probably locked. Check the bone properties or you have a constraint issue.",
    "Tip 41": "Rendering takes time. Go make tea, touch grass, or contemplate your life choices while you wait.",
    "Tip 42": "The answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42. The answer to 'why won't this bone move?' is usually parenting.",
    "Tip 43": "B-bones make your bones bendy. Regular bones are straight. Choose based on your anatomical needs!",
    "Tip 44": "Camera view is Numpad 0. If you can't see anything, your camera is probably looking at the void.",
    "Tip 45": "Drivers let you control properties with math. Because sometimes you need calculus in your animation workflow.",
    "Tip 46": "Onion skinning shows previous/next frames as ghosts. Not actual ghosts. Those would require different software.",
    "Tip 47": "If you're stuck, try restarting Blender. If still stuck, Google it. If still stuck, accept your new life in tutorial hell.",
    "Tip 48": "Armature layers help organize bones. Out of sight, out of mind. Until you forget which layer has what.",
    "Tip 49": "Physics simulations are cool! But they're not part of pose/animation basics. Walk before you run, grasshopper.",
    "Tip 50": "Remember: Blender is free. Your time is not. Sometimes the tutorial is worth watching at 2x speed.",
