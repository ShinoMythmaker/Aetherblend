Aetherblend is a Blender plugin designed to help you import characters and animate with ease. Aetherblend determines what bones are present in the vanilla armature and generates a rigify rig to the exact proportions of your character, including NPCs and monsters. 

This add-on is multipurpose and can be used for gposing, modding or animating in Blender!

<b>Note: Aetherblend is currently in early development and not complete.</b>

## Notable Features

## Limitations
- Pose import is not supported
- Animation import is not supported
- Some NPCs may not generate rigs correctly
- Monster rig generation is not yet supported

<b>It is recommended you disable Customise+ when exporting your character. Instead, export with Reference Pose & Scale enabled and apply your C+ edits using Aetherblend's built in functions. Make sure Apply Pose Track is checked on import to Blender.</b>

## Acknowledgements
💖 A heartfelt thank you to [Oats](https://github.com/ExplosiveOats), my official Co-Dev. Working with her on developing and maintaining AetherBlend has been an absolute privilege. She played a crucial role in getting our beta release across the finish line and continues to go above and beyond helping our community members on Discord every single day. I genuinely couldn't have done this without her, and I'm incredibly excited for everything we'll accomplish together!

💖 [Zed](https://x.com/RoseHikari24) and [CC](https://x.com/CC_VibesXIV), two of my very closest friends that let me yap for countless hours about issues with this project and kept motivating me to go on. Really without them I think I wouldnt have finished it, thank you!

💖 [PassiveModding](https://github.com/PassiveModding) - Thanks for [Meddle](https://github.com/PassiveModding/Meddle), and [Meddle Tools](https://github.com/PassiveModding/MeddleTools), while not being a requirement, these tools brought me back to actually bringing my characters into Blender and making me want to create a better Animation solution. 

💖 [sleepybunny](https://github.com/sleepybnuuy) for providing an excellent base for the C+ application with [bustomize](https://github.com/sleepybnuuy/bustomize)

💖 Ofcourse everyone that showed interest in not only AetherBlend but also [Mektools](https://github.com/MekuMaki/Mektools) and [Mythtools](https://github.com/ShinoMythmaker/Myth-Tools) aswell as all my supporters on Patreon.
